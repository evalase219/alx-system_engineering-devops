A server is an actual computer or a virtual devie that provides
functionality for other programs or devices called clients.

The role of the domain name is that it allows the users to
access websites, without kowing the IP address associated
with the websites.

The type of DNS record www in www.foobar.com is A record.

The role of the web server is that it accepts requests made by
the web browser through HTTP, then process the request by displaying
it with HTML content.

The role of the application server is that it provides access to
business logic for use by the client apllication programs.

The role of the database is to create, update, manage and retrieve
records.

The server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting
the website is HTTP

The infrastructure above has no redundancy( that is repetition of information
or functionality) that can be help to avoid SPOF,hence any single failure
in any part of the system will cause all the system to stop.

Downtime can occur in the above infrastructure because we only have one server
and one database,that is use to make deployment and maintenance hence no user
will access the website at that time.

The above infrastructure cannot scale if there too much incoming traffic because
there is no second server in the system to share the loads and it will be over loaded.
