We just added another server and a load balancer(HAproxy).
The reason for adding the above two is to control traffic.
As the number of the users are increasing, one server cannot
be able to handle the request, therefore we need more servers.
The load balancer is used to distribute the work-load on the
individual server which in turn increases the reliability,
efficiency and availabilty of the servers.

My load balancer distribution algorithms for my web infrastructure,
is Round Robin Scheduling: In this algorithm requests are served by
the server sequentially one after another.For example: Request 1 can
be direct to server 1 and request 2 can be directed to server 2, etc.

My load balancer is Active-Active setup.
The difference between active-active setup and active-passive setup
is that: in active-active setup, the load balancer spreads out the
work-load's traffic among the multiple server while in active-passive
setup the load balancer recognizes a failed server and redirect the
load to the next server.

Primary Replica(Master-slave) enables data from one database server
(the master) to be replicated to one or more other database servers
(the slaves). The master logs the updates, which the ripple through
to the slaves. If the changes are made to the master and slave at
the same time, it is synchronous.

The difference between the primary node and the Replica node in the
regard to the apllication is that, the primary node is the
authouritative source while the Replica(slave) databases are
sychronized to the primary(master).

This infrastructure needs Firewalls, HTTPS and monitoring in order to
avoid the risk of SPOF(wchich is the component of a system that when
it fails, the entire system will fail)
